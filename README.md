## React app which connects to the GitHub API and searches for users

The app searches for a particular GitHub account name, and if there is a match
it displays user's profile details and a list of repositories.

Create-react-app was used to create the project.

I used an implementation of the simple redux store from here - [https://github.com/jhhayashi/react-native-course/blob/master/lecture/9-redux/simpleRedux/store.js](https://github.com/jhhayashi/react-native-course/blob/master/lecture/9-redux/simpleRedux/store.js)
to cache users and repositories.

My priority was not the UI, but rather to make the application work without any bugs.

### Available Scripts:

### `yarn`

Installs packages

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
